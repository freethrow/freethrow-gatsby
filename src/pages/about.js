            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This is my personal website - a place to write down some thoughts about topics that I find interesting
               and showcase some projects.</p>
            <p>I am an analyst, former scientist and freelance developer with over 15 years of experience. Being initially self taught,
               I started my way up from visual basic and the ADO/DAo world and Fortran 77 for numeric simulations.
                Upon discovering python (version 2.3) I started using it for all kind of automation tasks:
                 building reporting pipelines, exporting measurement data from the bare-bones instruments 
                 into excel or similar user-friendly reporting tools.
                 </p>
                 <p>I consider my self a data scientist, but thatâ€™s a long story. Today, I am fascinated by stuff like XGboost, 
                   deep learning, and the simplicity of the Random Forest algorithm. While I have never worked as a
                    full-time developer (I am an analyst at heart), I love to devour books,articles, 
                    tutorials, full-blown courses, speeches and conferences about analytics, web development,
                     data science, algorithms and similar topics. 
                     </p>
                     <p>I am  gathering material for a book (like there aren't already enough) about the mathematical and CS things
                        that I care about. Yep.</p>
